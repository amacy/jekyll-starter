This is the skeleton - folders and "essential" files - for a Jekyll site. 

I also intend to include the latest versions of:

- Twitter Bootstrap (for responsive design/CSS/jQuery magic)
- Modernizr (for cross-browser compatibility)

Visit the respective repos for the latest versions of their magic.

Additionally, it assumes you pre-compile CSS w/ SASS & JavaScript w/ CoffeeScript.
